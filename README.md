Titanfall
=========

Nearly completed Titanfall SRC

=========
Hi, I'm a Bukkit plugin developer who had been working on a Titanfall plugin for a month. I made guns, etc. but then I found out about Crackshot, so I removed the guns and implemented Crackshot. However, once I did this, I lacked any motivation to carry on due the new EULA preventing any extra perks from donating. So I decided to just post the nearly-finished but uncompleted source code for anyone else to use and build OR to just view how I did this, etc. and learn. This is not for server owners, this is for plugin developers (including those that work for servers).

You can be nice and give me credit, but you don't have to be. Enjoy!

Required dependencies:
- Vault
- CrackShot
